# C64 Emulator Architecture Plan

## Core Components to Implement

### 1. Memory Management
- Implement the C64's memory map (64KB total)
- Memory banking system for ROM/RAM switching
- Key memory regions:
  - $0000-$9FFF: RAM
  - $A000-$BFFF: BASIC ROM/RAM
  - $C000-$CFFF: RAM
  - $D000-$DFFF: I/O / Character ROM
  - $E000-$FFFF: KERNAL ROM

### 2. VIC-II (Video Interface Controller)
- Implement sprite handling (8 hardware sprites)
- Character modes (standard and multicolor)
- Bitmap modes (high resolution and multicolor)
- Screen memory and color memory handling
- Raster interrupts
- Screen refresh at 50Hz (PAL) or 60Hz (NTSC)

### 3. SID (Sound Interface Device)
- Three independent sound channels
- Four waveforms per voice (triangle, sawtooth, pulse, noise)
- ADSR envelope generator
- Filter system (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass)
- Ring modulation and synchronization

### 4. CIA (Complex Interface Adapter) - Two chips
- CIA1 (keyboard matrix, joystick port 2)
- CIA2 (serial bus, user port, joystick port 1)
- Timer functionality
- Interrupt handling

### 5. Input/Output Systems
- Keyboard matrix scanning
- Joystick ports
- Serial IEC bus (disk drive interface)
- Datasette port
- User port

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Framework
1. Create a main C64 struct that coordinates all components
2. Implement basic memory management and banking
3. Set up component communication channels

### Phase 2: Core Systems
1. VIC-II implementation starting with basic character mode
2. Basic SID implementation with single voice
3. Simple CIA implementation for keyboard input

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Complete VIC-II features (sprites, all video modes)
2. Full SID implementation
3. Complete CIA functionality
4. IEC serial bus for disk drive support

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
1. ROM loading and verification
2. Cycle-accurate timing
3. Full system integration tests
4. Compatibility testing with common software

## Testing Considerations

1. Individual Component Tests
- Memory banking operations
- Video mode switches
- Sound generation
- Timer accuracy
- Interrupt handling

2. Integration Tests
- Full system boot sequence
- BASIC interpreter functionality
- Peripheral communication
- Known software compatibility

3. Performance Tests
- Cycle accuracy verification
- Frame timing
- Audio timing
- Overall system performance

## Additional Considerations

1. Debug Features
- Memory viewers/editors
- Register monitors
- Breakpoint system
- Trace logging

2. Save States
- Component state serialization
- Full system state save/restore

3. Configuration
- PAL/NTSC selection
- Input mapping
- Audio/video settings
